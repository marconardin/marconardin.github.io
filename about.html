          <h1>About</h1>
          <p>
            My name is Marco, and I'm currently seeking a job in tech, biotech, or healthcare. My interests involve
            technology, computer science, and biology. I'm a Tufts University and Northeastern University graduate with a bachelor's in
            Biology and MSc in Bioinformatics respectively. Recently, I was employed at Massachusetts General Hospital as a
            Computational Clinical Research Coordinator where I was involved in stroke research. Before that, I was a
            Linux and Software Engineer at Lilee Systems, a telecommunications company that provides hardware, software,
            and other services for trains and buses based in San Jose, CA.
