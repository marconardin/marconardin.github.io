                    <p>My name is Marco, and I'm currently seeking a job in tech, biotech, or healthcare. My interests involve technology, computer science, biology, and continuing to level up physically and mentally. I'm a Tufts University and Northeastern University graduate in Biology and Bioinformatics respectively.
                    Recently, I was employed at Massachusetts General Hospital as a Computational Clinical Research Coordinator where I was involved in stroke research.
                    Before that, I was a Linux and Software Engineer at Lilee Systems, a telecommunications company that provides hardware, software, and other services for trains and buses based in San Jose, CA.</p>
