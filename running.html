                    <h2>My Story</h2>
                        <p>I love running. It's something I've been doing from a very young age when I played soccer (where I was dubbed the 'roadrunner' by my teammates and coaches for constantly running up and down the field), through middle school and high school on the cross-country and track teams, and now as an adult for my own personal fulfillment.
                        There is something special about running in the way that it makes you feel deeply connected to yourself, widely to the people around you, and profoundly to our forebears. As of yet, I have not been able to find an activity that provides the same experience that peak running presents naturally.
                        Running is an activity I highly recommend, not only as a method of staying physically active but as a way of honing your mind and spirit.</p>

                    <h2>The Present Day</h2>
                        <p>To this day I continue to run and make it part of my weekly ritual. I'm currently training for the Marine Corps Marathon in October where my goal is to run between at 3:00 and 3:30 marathon.</p>

                    <h2>Pace Calculator</h2>
                        <p>I've added a pace calculator here since I think it's a handy tool for seeing what your goal pace would be given the amount of time you want to run over a given distance.</p>
